Flask App with SQLite and Docker

This repository contains a Flask application that uses SQLite as the database and is containerized using Docker. The application provides a simple API for managing administrators, applicants, households, schemes, applications, and scheme-related information such as benefits and criteria.

Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

Docker: You can download and install Docker from here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Docker Compose: This should come pre-installed with Docker Desktop. If not, follow the Docker Compose installation instructions.
How to Run the Application

To run the Flask application using Docker, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/flask-sqlite-docker-app.git

cd SWE-Assignment-main

Open Docker Desktop Preferences:
Open Docker Desktop on your Mac.
Click on the Docker icon in the macOS menu bar.
Select Preferences (or Settings depending on your version).
Go to the Resources Section:
In the Preferences window, select Resources from the left sidebar.
Then, select File Sharing.
Add the Path to Your Shared Directories:
In the File Sharing tab, youâ€™ll see a list of directories that are shared with Docker.
Click the + button to add a new directory.
Navigate to /Downloads/SWE-Assignment-main and add it to the shared paths.
Click Apply & Restart to save the changes and restart Docker.
Verify Permissions:
Once Docker restarts, it should have access to the /Downloads/SWE-Assignment-main directory.
Run your Docker commands again, and the error should be resolved.

Run Docker Compose: Docker Compose will build the image and run the application along with the necessary environment setup.
bash
docker-compose up

This will start the application on http://localhost:5001.

Stopping the containers: To stop the Docker containers, press Ctrl + C in the terminal or run:
bash
docker-compose down
